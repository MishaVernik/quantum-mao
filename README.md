# Quantum PSO

## Description
This project showcases implementations in both Python and Q# to demonstrate the versatility and power of quantum computing in conjunction with classical computing approaches. The Python code is executed in a Jupyter environment, leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 for generating functions, while the Q# implementation is crafted using Azure Quantum Workspace to explore quantum algorithms.

## Python Implementation
To run the Python code:
1. Access the Jupyter Notebook environment through this link: [Try Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/notebooks/index.html?path=Untitled.ipynb).
2. Utilize the ChatGPT-4 model to generate functions directly within the Jupyter notebooks, allowing for an interactive development experience.

## Q# Quantum Implementation
To run the Q# code:
1. Open the Azure Quantum Workspace in Visual Studio Code via this link: [Azure Quantum Playground](https://vscode.dev/quantum/playground/).
2. Navigate to the sample projects provided in the Q# Pocket Guide Samples on GitHub for reference: [Q# Samples](https://github.com/tcNickolas/q-sharp-pocket-guide-samples/tree/main/samples).
